About Me
----------------------------------------

A long, long time ago, when I was a teenager and I discovered the depths of the Internet, I became interested in something called Front-end (at that time I didn't know it). I could play all the free time in creating websites. I created for myself and saved all my works on disk. And I was proud of it. Unfortunately, not everyone understood this. Especially parents. I was forced to give up my dreams of design and start wandering in search of my path - but I never found it. I kept thinking back to those times, and I know that I want to come back to this path again, because that was it. Especially since I'm a creative and stubborn person. I learn very quickly and I have no problems with communication. Due to diligence, I devoted myself to the work I have. And finally I want to do what I love and earn from it.
